                    what is c++
                    C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

                    C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
                   C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                   
                   C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                   
                   C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                    is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
                    C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.
                                       
                    The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20</p>

                                   <header>object</header>
                    
                   C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                   
                   C++ is fun and easy to learn!
                   
                   As C++               <p>
                               An object is a data structure that is an instance of a class. So when a class is created no memory
                                is allocated but when an instance is created by declaring an object, memory is then allocated to 
                                store data and perform required functions on them. We can visualize trees, birds, and dogs as 
                                different classes and their instances like neem tree, peacock, and german shepherd dog respectivel
                                y. Hence, class and object in C++ are the main ingredients of object-oriented programming.
                                       In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.
                                        In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data 
                                        and behavior means functionality.
                                         Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.In C++, an object is created from a
                                          class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.
                   
                                         To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name.
                                         
                                   To access the class attributes (myNum and myString), use the dot syntax (.) on the object</p>

                               Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing
                                    classes. The new class created is called “derived class” or “child class” and the existing 
                                    class is known as the “base class” or “parent class”. The derived class now is said to be 
                                    inherited from the base class.
                                When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class inherits all the
                                 properties of the base class, without changing the properties of base class and may add new 
                                 features to its own. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class.
                                  The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
                   
                            Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Subclass or Derived Class. 
                           Super Class: The class whose properties are inherited by a subclass is called Base Class or Superclass.</p>

                                   Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to 
                                   each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us 
                                   inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform 
                                   different tasks. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be
                                    displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the 
                                    same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, 
                                    and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This
                                     is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of
                                      Object-Oriented Programming.</p>

                                   Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++.
                                    Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to
                                     providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details
                                      or implementation.The purpose of an abstract class (often referred to as an ABC) is to provide an 
                                      appropriate base class from which other classes can inherit. Abstract classes cannot be used to 
                                      instantiate objects and serves only as an interface. Attempting to instantiate an object of an
                                       abstract class causes a compilation error.
